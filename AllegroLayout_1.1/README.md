Its GPU implementation is hundreds of times faster than the CPU implementation which exploits single core of the latest CPU.</p><p>It also provides the layout animation which shows the layout progress of a large complex network in realtime. You can even zoom and pan it while the layout is being processed.</p><p>For more information, please visit us at http://allegroviva.com/allegrolayout/.
