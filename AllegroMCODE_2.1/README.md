* __Plugin Name__
  * AllegroMCODE
* __Version__
  * 2.1
* __Description__
  * <p>AllegroMCODE Plugin is a high-performance MCODE cluster finder supporting both of CPU and GPU clustering. Clusters in a protein interaction network can be considered as protein complexes and functional modules, which can be identified as highly interconnected subgraphs.</p><p>It finds the same clusters as the MCODE plugin does, but to process large complex networks, it is totally redesigned for fast analysis, low memory consumption, and interactive cluster exploring without creating a network view or subnetwork.</p><p>It includes our proprietary highly parallel algorithm based on the original sequential MCODE algorithm and exploits massively parallel GPU computing architecture to make your analysis task faster than ever. Its GPU analysis usually takes less than a second to analyze a large complex network.</p><p>For more information, please visit us at http://allegroviva.com/allegromcode/.
