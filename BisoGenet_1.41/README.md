* __Version__
  * 1.41
* __Description__
  * \This plugin allows searching molecular interactions from <b>SysBiomics</b>, our in-house \database, and displaying the result as an interaction network within Cytoscape. \<b>SysBiomics</b> integrates data from well-known interaction databases including \<b>DIP</b>, <b>BIOGRID</b>, <b>HPRD</b>, <b>BIND</b>, <b>MINT</b> and <b>INTACT</b>.<br/>\<b>BisoGenet</b> provides an easy to use interface allowing users to customize the searches by \specifying a target set of genes/proteins to retrieve interactions data for, \specifying a subcontext around the targets to narrow the interactions data searching space, \defining a selection filter to discard/include interactions (within the specified \subcontext) given its nature, primary databases and supporting experimental methods. <br/>\Interaction network's gene/protein associated info includes annotations from <b>NCBI</b>, \<b>UniProt</b>, <b>KEGG</b>, and <b>GO</b> databases while interaction info includes \the supporting experimental methods and hyperlinks to their primary databases entries and \related publications.<br/>\<b>BisoGenet</b> also includes network topology analysis tools such as <b>Shortest Paths\</b> between a set of nodes, determination of <b>Equivalent Nodes</b>, and <b>Network \Statistics</b> reports in combination to interactive <b>Transparency filter</b> to help \discernig such analytical results in the context of dense networks.
