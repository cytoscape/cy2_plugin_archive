---- CABIN Sample Data Release Policy ----
 
By using the sample protein-protein interaction datasets provided within CABIN, the user agrees to the following.
 
PNNL/ORNL is not responsible for errors contained in the protein-protein interaction datasets, or for consequences arising from using the protein-protein interaction datasets. Forthcoming publications from us will detail methods and controls used in the acquisition of data underlying the sample protein-protein interaction datasets. 
 
The following acknowledgement must be included in any publications, presentations, reports, databases, websites, or data analyses that have used the CABIN protein-protein interaction datasets: \"Protein-protein interaction data were obtained from the Center for Molecular and Cellular Systems (mippi.ornl.gov) which is sponsored at Oak Ridge National Laboratory by the U.S. Department of Energy Office of Biological and Environmental Research.\" The following paper needs to be cited in any research facilitated by CABIN: Singhal, M., Domico, K., \"CABIN: Collective Analysis of Biological Interaction Networks\", Computat. Biol. Chem. (2007), doi:10.1016/j.compbiolchem.2007.03.006.
 
We reserve the right to publish a description of the overall protein-protein interaction datasets, and the methods used to obtain the contents of the dataset.
