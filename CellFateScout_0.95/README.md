* __Plugin Name__
  * CellFateScout
* __Version__
  * 0.95
* __Description__
  * We developed CellFateScout that uses the method of Latent Variables to turn differential high-throughput expression data and a functional network into a list of active signalling pathways. Applying it to Connectivity Map data, i.e., differential expression data describing small molecule effects, we then generated a Human Small Molecule Mechanisms Database (available at https://sourceforge.net/projects/cellfatescout/). Finally, using a list of active signalling pathways as query, a similarity search can identify small molecules from the database that may trigger these pathways. CellFateScout can be used to select small molecules for their desired effects.<br>CellFateScout tutorial is available at sourceforge.net/projects/cellfatescout/files/CellFateScout_tutorial_v0.94.ppt/<p>
