  * Transcription factors (TFs) play a fundamental role in cellular regulation by binding to promoter regions of target genes (TGs) in order to control their gene expression. TF-TG networks are widely used as representations of regulatory mechanisms, e.g. for modeling the cellular response to input signals and perturbations.

As the experimental identification of regulatory interactions is time consuming and expensive, one tries to use knowledge from related species when studying an organism of interest. Here, we present ConReg, an interactive web application to store regulatory relations for various species and to investigate their level of conservation in related species. Currently, ConReg contains data for eight model organisms. The regulatory relations stored in publicly available databases cover only a small fraction both of the actual interactions and also of the regulatory relations described in the scientific literature. Therefore, we included regulatory relations extracted from PubMed and PubMedCentral using sophisticated text-mining approaches and from binding site predictions into ConReg.

ConReg can be used to analyze and visualize regulatory networks and their conservation among eight model organisms. It also provides direct links to annotations including literature references to potentially conserved regulatory relations.
