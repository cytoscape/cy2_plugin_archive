* __Plugin Name__
  * DomainGraph
* __Version__
  * 3.01
* __Description__
  * The main functionality of the DomainGraph plugin is the<br>visual analysis of the effects of alternative splicing<br>on genes, protein isoforms, molecular interactions,<br>pathways and miRNA binding sites. Statistical results<br>of Exon Array data computed with AltAnalyze can be<br>imported into DomainGraph and affected genes, pathways and<br>miRNA binding sites are automatically annotated. From<br>these annotations, genes, gene products, and pathways<br>can directly be loaded and visualized via DomainGraph and<br>occurrences of alternative splicing are highlighted. Therefore,<br> an in-depth analysis of Exon Array data regarding<br>alternative splicing events and their biological impact<br>is easily possible without the need of prior knowledge.<br>Furthermore, the detailed analysis of interaction networks<br>and pathways is possible. Given a gene interaction<br>network, DomainGraph visualizes the genes together with<br>all known encoded protein isoforms and their respective<br>domain compositions. Given a protein interaction network,<br>DomainGraph decomposes the proteins into their domains and<br>visualizes the domain interactions underlying the protein<br>interactions. These networks can be integrated with<br>exon expression data produced by the Affymetrix Exon<br>Array. Genes, protein isoforms and domains are highlighted<br>according to potentially occurring alternative splicing<br>events or differential expression in different groups of samples.
