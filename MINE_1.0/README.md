* __Description__
  * MINE is an agglomerative clustering method that is able to identify highly modular sets of gene products within dense molecular interaction networks.  It was created in response to the challenge of discovering high quality modules of gene products from dense biological networks.  The algorithm allows a high degree of flexibility and user-customisation of results with few adjustable parameters.<p>
