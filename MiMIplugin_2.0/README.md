MiMI gathers and merges data from well-known protein interaction databases including BIND, DIP, HPRD, RefSeq, SwissProt, IPI and CCSB-HI1 etc. A provenance model has been developed that tracks the source of each data element and what processes have been performed upon it. The plugin also integrates with other NCIBI tools for literature information, document summarization and pathway matching.</p>
