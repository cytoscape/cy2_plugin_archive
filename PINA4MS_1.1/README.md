  * The <b>P</b>rotein <b>I</b>nteraction <b>N</b>etwork <b>A</b>nalysis For <b>M</b>ultiple <b>S</b>ets (PINA4MS) is a visualization and analysis tool to study interactions between multiple sets of proteins.<br/><br/>PINA4MS uses the curated protein-protein interaction data from <a href=\"http://cbg.garvan.unsw.edu.au/pina/\">PINA</a> and kinase-substrate relationships from <a href=\"http://www.phosphosite.org/\">PhosphoSitePlus</a> to link proteins both intra- and inter- multiple sets. A number of unique features have also been developed to facilitate the analysis including: <ol><li><b>Customized node pie chart</b> allowing users to easily identify common and distinct proteins in the input sets, as well as interactions between different sets;</li><li>A <b>clickable Venn diagram</b> is provided on the side panel to support quick selection and highlight of exclusive set(s) of proteins in the network; </li><li>A customized layout algorithm, <b>Venn-Galaxy</b> layout, is implemented to provide an elaborate view on the localization of the protein sets and highlight the interface and connections in between.</li></ol>
