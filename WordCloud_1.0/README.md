* __Description__
  * When biological networks are studied, it is common to look for clusters, i.e. sets of nodes that are highly inter-connected. To understand the \\\\\\\"biological meaning\\\\\\\" of a cluster, the user usually has to sift through many textual annotations that are associated with biological entities. The WordCloud Cytoscape plugin generates a visual summary of these annotations by displaying them as a âtag cloudâ, where more frequent words are displayed using a larger font size. Word co-occurrence in a phrase can be visualized by arranging words in clusters or as a network. These visualizations provide a concise visual summary of annotations which is helpful for network analysis and interpretation.
